# The Io Programming Language

## Introduction
>The Io languageâ€™s syntax is simple and
low-level, like the name. Io syntax simply chains messages together,
with each message returning an object and each message taking optional parameters in parentheses. In Io, everything is a message that
returns another receiver.  
With Io, you won't worry about both classes and objects. You'll deal exclusively in objects, cloning them as needed. These clones are called _prototypes_. Io is the **prototype based** programming language.  
In a _prototype language_ , every objects is a clone of an existing object rather tha a class.
